 TFG – U.S.–China Trade Tensions and Global Supply Chains (2018–2025)

This repository contains the Python code and visualizations developed for my **Undergraduate Thesis in Economics (University of Barcelona)**:

**“The Impact of Trade Tensions between the United States and China on Global Supply Chains: From the 2018 Conflict to the 2025 Tariff Crisis”**

---

 Introduction

Since 2018, trade tensions between the United States and China have reshaped international trade flows, supply chain structures, and investment strategies.  
This thesis analyzes the **2018–2025 period**, with a special focus on the **2025 tariff crisis**, combining theoretical review, case studies, and empirical data analysis with Python.

The study explores:
- Bilateral trade and tariff escalation.  
- The impact on key global value chains (technology, automotive, intermediate goods).  
- Corporate and governmental responses to growing uncertainty.  
- Future scenarios of globalization and economic fragmentation.

 Objectives

- Assess the evolution of U.S.–China trade tensions since 2018.  
- Quantify the impact of tariffs on bilateral trade balance and global supply chains.  
- Examine sectoral disruptions (technology, agriculture, machinery).  
- Analyze adaptation strategies by firms (diversification, automation, reshoring).  
- Evaluate government responses (industrial policy, subsidies, trade alliances).  
- Explore future scenarios of deglobalization and supply chain reconfiguration.

Results & Conclusions

- **Persistent trade deficit**: Despite tariffs, the U.S. maintained a structural trade deficit with China, reflecting deep dependence on Chinese imports.  
- **Short-term deficit reduction, not structural**: The 2025 tariff crisis reduced imports and partially lowered the deficit, but mainly through contraction of trade rather than improved competitiveness.  
- **Sectoral disruptions**: Technology and automotive were the most affected industries, with cascading effects on global supply chains and inflationary pressures.  
- **Corporate strategies**: Firms adopted **China+1 diversification**, reshoring, and automation to mitigate risks.  
- **Government responses**: The U.S. promoted reshoring and subsidies (e.g., CHIPS Act), while China accelerated self-sufficiency (Made in China 2025).  
- **Case studies**: Apple diversified production, Huawei pursued technological self-reliance, and Tesla restructured its raw material supply.  
- **Global impact**: The EU, including Spain, was indirectly hit via rising intermediate goods prices and inflation, sparking debates on strategic autonomy.  
- **Future outlook**: Deglobalization and supply chain regionalization appear more likely than a return to pre-2018 trade integration.
